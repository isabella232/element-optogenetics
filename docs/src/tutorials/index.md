# Tutorials

+ DataJoint Elements are modular pipelines that can be connected into a complete workflow.  [Workflow Optogenetics](https://github.com/datajoint/workflow-optogenetics)) is an example that combines four DataJoint Elements - Lab, Animal, Session, and Optogenetics.

+ Workflow Optogenetics includes an [interactive tutorial on GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/datajoint/workflow-optogenetics#interactive-tutorial), which is configured for users to run the pipeline.

+ In the interactive tutorial, the [example notebook](https://github.com/datajoint/workflow-optogenetics/tree/main/notebooks/tutorial.ipynb) describes the pipeline and provides instructions for adding data to the pipeline.

## Installation Instructions for Active Projects

+ The Workflow Optogenetics described above can be modified for a user's specific experimental requirements and thereby used in active projects.  

+ The GitHub Codespace and Dev Container is configured for tutorials and prototyping.  
We recommend users to configure a database specifically for production pipelines.  Instructions for a local installation of the integrated development environment with a database can be found on the [User Guide](https://datajoint.com/docs/elements/user-guide/) page.
